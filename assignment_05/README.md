### exercise

This weeks exercise is to produce a visualization of some sort, using this weeks lecture and dialog as a point of reference. You are not bound by typical data formats, but you are still free to use them. You are not bound by any visualization form or chart type. However, you must abide by the constraints, and they are outlined below.

Constraint 1: You must create your data.
Your data can be logged, photographed, sensed using your iphone, recorded, survey results, etc. The data can be about you or something else. Data can be collected from the internet or the real world. Simply put, the data must be of you or from you, that is, you turned something into data (for example, let's say you want to work on residential home styles from the 1950's to now, and you detail the characteristics that define each style so you can visualize it).

Constraint 2:  You must experiment with forms!
Use this opportunity to develop your chart vocabulary and/or expand into different mediums. I've given copious examples of what different forms visualizations can take: hand drawn, photographic, programmatic, etc. Find some inspiration! What I don't want to see are basic charts and default charts from charting software. Of course use them as a resource if needed.

Constraint 3: 
When you present your visualization (make sure it has a title!), you will talk about it after we discuss and critique it. That is, you cannot help us understand it until after we have attempted to do so. This does not mean that you must create a piece that effectively communicates the data unless that is what you aim to do. We will simply discuss and appreciate the visualization for what it is.
