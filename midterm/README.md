### Scenario:

A museum is planning an exhibition on gender. They have not quite framed the exhibition yet, and are looking at you, the creative director, to handle that. In addition, it is your job to come up with three installation ideas that clearly fall within your chosen theme and clearly visualize the data in your sources. Don't limit yourself by thinking of a kiosk type interaction. Dream big!

**Your concepts should include:**

- **a description or user flow of the experience**
- **images of the installation at large**
- **a focus view on the visualization**

Included with these concepts will be a **Title for the exhibit** and **a description of the exhibit theme**.
