### exercise 1

Take the below chart and remake it. Feel free to model this if you want, but I am mainly looking to see how clearly you can relay this information to the audience and what design choices you make. Feel free to model this if you want, but I am mainly looking to see how clearly you can relay this information to the audience (your peers) and what design choices you make (experiment with visualization types!). You can use any digital or analog (crayons!) tools you like.

### exercise 2

Take the below charts made by Edward Tufte and take it from minimal to something else. As you see here, it's black and white, clear and concise. Do something else to it. Feel free to redesign or rechart it!

To minimize some of the work, you have the option to limit yourself to just the "Trouble Index" and the "Cost Index" under the "Trouble Spots" column. This will help you focus on the more important aspects for this task. But feel free to use the entire data set. Once again...use any digital or analog tools at your disposal.
