### exercise

Examine your chosen dataset. Find something novel about the data. We donâ€™t want to see general visualizations unless its part of your analysis, rather, we want to see specifics. See if you can find something, and pull a story out. This might require quickly visualizing something to form a new vector and then the process happens over again.
